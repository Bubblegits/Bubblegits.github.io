The crackling of wood in the fireplace added warmth to the quiet atmosphere. Maxwell was in the kitchen, preparing lunch. On the refrigerator were photos of him and Julia: one from their trip to Europe just after they were married. They were standing together on an old bridge.\nAh! But there is no butter left in the refrigerator! And the storage of pork and beef is also running low. he has to go to the marketplace to get some. He put on his jacket and prepared for getting out, that’s when Julia came down from the stairs.\nShe just woke up, wearing pajamas and slippers. There’s still drowsiness on her face. Maxwell took a glance at her, and kept walking towards the door.\n“Wait a minute, where are you going?”\nMaxwell stopped and gave her a smile. “To the bar to meet some young ladies.”\n“Seems like I’m falling behind the times, bars nowadays open in the morning, huh?”\nMaxwell kept smiling.\n“Anyway, Good luck with the ladies. I’ve got a special present for you” Julia turned towards the bedroom, and went back with an envelope, “Don’t open it until you get to the bar.”\n“Well, thank you.” The envelope is thin, feels like there is almost nothing in it.\nMaxwell stepped out from the house and opened the envelope, in it were coupons for the Marketplace. There’s gonna be a price draw and the winner will get a flight ticket to Florence. He had never left Boston since he got married with Julia, and he won’t even if he gets the ticket. He has so many things to do.\nFlorence…… Who talked to him about this place? It’s Amy, isn’t it? They were sitting in the car at that time.\nThe radio was playing a folk song, with gentle chords of the guitar. This was the first time that Amy agreed to go home together with him after school. Maxwell had been anxious all the way, he stared at the road, held the steering wheel so tightly as if someone’s gonna rob it from him. They eventually stopped the car in front of Amy house, now Maxwell can take a breath.\n“Don’t forget to talk with your parents about the trip! Can’t believe we need to wait for another two months until summer vacation comes.”\n“Good news is that tomorrow is Saturday. Do you want to meet at the cafe?”\n“Sure! See you tomorrow.”\nThe next day Maxwell went to the flower shop, wishing to buy Amy some roses. Will Amy be happy when she sees the flower? She said she love roses, but did she mean it or was she just trying to make conversation？\n“Hi, can I get a bouquet of roses?”\n“Of course, is it for your girlfriend?” Cara had seen many young men, shy yet inwardly excited. She knew Maxwell is one of them when she saw his slightly curly hair and bright eyes that are expecting for love.\nMaxwell was embarrassed, he tried to pretend that he was already a grown-up that knows what love is, viewing himself this way makes he feel comfortable. But Cara seemed trustable. “Yes”, he confessed.\n“Well, if you are not being late for the date, I can give you some suggestions. What kind of girl is she?”\n“She’s … beautiful.” Maxwell preferred to treat the relationship between them as a secret. He feels like that there’s something special in it, and once he started to talk about their relationship, the special part would be gone.\n“Have you ever read James Joyce?”\n“I’ve read a few short stories of him” As a matter of fact, Maxwell had never read anything written by Joyce.\n“‘Every boy has a little sweet heart’, He once said. I thought what he said about boys and sweethearts was sensible”\n“But I feel like Amy is special for me.”\n“Ah, I understand, but every boy has a girl that changed his life. You are the lucky one because you have her by your side.”\n“You are right, we spent a lot of time together. We are planning to go to Florence this summer.”\n“Cool! Florence is a beautiful city. I’ve heard that the it got its name from a Latin word that means ’to blossom’.”\n“Really?” I’m gonna tell Amy about this.\n“You must be really looking forward to the arrival of summer, right?”\n“Yeah, and we have many summers to spend together.”\n“Oh, I didn’t expect a boy of your age thinking about things that will happen ten years later.” She gave a smile, making her words sound less serious, “Here’s your flower.”\nCara added some herbs to the bouquet. Walking on the street, Maxwell caught the aroma in the air, a mysterious aroma.\nMaxwell saw Amy on the table at the corner, He hid his flower behind his back and gently stepped near her. He shivered when Amy raised her head——never had he seen such a look in Amy’s eyes. He seated on the seat with the flower still behind his back.\n“What happened?”\n“I’m going to leave Boston after high school. My family are moving to Philadelphia”\nHe should have expected that. Amy’s parents had business there, and they had always wanted Amy to go to Curtis.\nSilence.\n“But you won’t leave until next year, will you? We can still go to Florence this summer”\nThey did go to Florence. They visited the Pitti Palace, spent some time in the Florence Cathedral, enjoyed Botticelli’s work in the Uffizi Gallery. They met each other for a few times in the last year of high school, and Maxwell went to Boston University. He read some books, and a passage by Rousseau left a deep impression on him.\n“As soon as they envisage from afar their separation, as soon as they foresee the moment which is going to make them strangers to one another, they are already strangers. Each sets up his own little separate system; and both engrossed by the time they will no longer be together, stay only reluctantly.”\nSo that’s it, now he is again walking on the street, with shopping bag in his hand.\nMaxwell got back to his home his daughter was dancing with her teddy bear on the dining table. He knew he should make her get off from the table, otherwise she may fall.\n“I love my teddy bear!”\n“I know you love him, darling, but could you get off the table?”\n“Julia is right, you will fall down and get hurt.”\n“I can see outside the window from up here, Isn’t that Kate’s house? There’s smoke coming out from the chimney”\n“Oh, you reminded me, another reason that you must come down is that we are going to have lunch”\n“Are we? But you were in the bedroom the whole morning”\n“I’m the one who cooked”\n“Oh, that means we will have garlic butter steak today! steak!”\n“Not until you get off the table”\n“3, 2, 1, jump!”\n",

<p>They did go to Florence. They visited the Pitti Palace, spent some time in the Florence Cathedral, enjoyed Botticelli&rsquo;s work in the Uffizi Gallery. They met each other for a few times in the last year of high school, and Maxwell went to Boston University. He read some books, and a passage by Rousseau left a deep impression on him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As soon as they envisage from afar their separation, as soon as they foresee the moment which is going to make them strangers to one another, they are already strangers. Each sets up his own little separate system; and both engrossed by the time they will no longer be together, stay only reluctantly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s it, now he is again walking on the street, with shopping bag in his hand.</p>
<p>Maxwell got back to his home his daughter was dancing with her teddy bear on the dining table. He knew he should make her get off from the table, otherwise she may fall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I love my teddy bear!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you love him, darling, but could you get off the table?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Julia is right, you will fall down and get hurt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can see outside the window from up here, Isn&rsquo;t that Kate&rsquo;s house? There&rsquo;s smoke coming out from the chimney&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you reminded me, another reason that you must come down is that we are going to have lunch&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are we? But you were in the bedroom the whole morning&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m the one who cooked&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that means we will have garlic butter steak today! steak!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not until you get off the table&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;3, 2, 1, jump!&rdquo;</p>
