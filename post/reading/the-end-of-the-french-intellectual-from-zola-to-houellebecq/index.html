Page 10 @ 30 March 2023 11:02 AM They seem to think that an empty head means they’ve really got balls.’ Simone\nPage 33 @ 21 April 2023 02:31 AM Bad conscience is certainly a mark of civilization and morality that has to be preserved, but in no way does it form a preventive insurance against the stupidity, hypocrisy and cynical exploitation of a painful past.\nPage 35 @ 21 April 2023 02:39 AM Many young readers’ heroes are bound to lose their aura when their readers reach maturity. The myth of the intellectual that I forged for myself at a relatively young age pressed me to acquire knowledge, stimulated my political commitment and opened the gates of writing to me. But it was shaken when I myself became a kind of petty intellectual.\nPage 36 @ 21 April 2023 02:43 AM All the same, when I taught, I found myself stifling the explicit criticisms I was nurturing about historical decisions and developments;\n● 尽管如此，当我教书的时候，我发现自己在扼杀我对历史决定和发展的明确批评；\nPage 37 @ 21 April 2023 02:44 AM The principle of pedagogic pluralism is no doubt correct, but I know today that mine was also pervaded by a fearful conformism, bound up with my still unstable institutional situation.\n● 教学多元主义的原则无疑是正确的，但我今天知道，我的内心也充满了可怕的循规蹈矩，这与我仍然不稳定的体制状况有关。\nPage 37 @ 21 April 2023 02:45 AM I had come from a disadvantaged social background and, knowing that university work provided for upward social mobility, I more or less consciously sought constantly to internalize the borders between the possible and the impossible, between what was authorized and what was forbidden.\nPage 40 @ 28 April 2023 11:10 AM In our day, the traps are no longer the same, and we have to live through new conflicts without nostalgia for the battles of the past.\nIntroduction: The City and the Pen Page 42 @ 28 April 2023 11:12 AM But Paris is in actual fact all of France. The rest is just a great suburb of Paris … The whole of France is a desert, at least in intellectual terms. All that is distinguished in the provinces emigrates early on to the capital, the focus of all light and all brilliance.\nPage 47 @ 28 April 2023 12:44 PM intellectuals have long been the last aristocrats.\nPage 47 @ 28 April 2023 12:47 PM And if the monarchist tradition has been replaced by a popular thirst for authoritarian and paternalist presidents, a deep nostalgia for knights and musketeers, seemingly foreign to bourgeois values, has also contributed to the prestige of this modern ‘nobility of mind’, who confront dangers and brandish their sharpened pens to defend truth and justice.\nPage 48 @ 28 April 2023 12:48 PM famous distinction between a ‘class in itself’, in other words an objective sociological fact, which human subjects are not necessarily aware of belonging to, and a ‘class for itself’, when subjects see themselves as forming part of a group and act in the context of this identity and according to its demands\nPage 49 @ 28 April 2023 12:51 PM France in the Age of Enlightenment was the place where men of letters created an agora in which a hegemonic discourse with a universal essence was developed\n● 启蒙时代的法国是文人创造集市的地方，在这个集市上发展了具有普遍本质的霸权话语\nPage 49 @ 28 April 2023 01:11 PM By ‘public sphere’, I have in mind the public field of debate, which in a liberal democracy is open despite its relations of dependence with the apparatuses of the state and/or big capital, enabling it to maintain various levels of autonomous dialogue in relation to these powers\nPage 52 @ 28 April 2023 01:07 PM It is not only high politics that is decided in Paris, but also all the strategies, novelties and changes in the fields of cultural creation. By way of comparison, in Great Britain we find quite a high degree of centralization, but not equalling that of France. Oxford, Cambridge and even Edinburgh have maintained a power and effect in relation to London. In the United States, Germany or Italy, the morphology of the public sphere has a radically different shape: establishments of higher education, newspapers, reviews and periodicals, publishing houses and high cultural creation have always existed here in a far more dispersed and pluralist manner, whereas in France everything is essentially limited to Paris.\nPage 54 @ 28 April 2023 01:14 PM As a result, to clarify the specificity of the intellectual in France, it is necessary to start by defining him or her as a Parisian intellectual.\nPage 56 @ 28 April 2023 01:32 PM basic sociological fact has to be noted. Across the rest of France the intelligentsia has almost always lived and acted as a receptacle of the ideological products and cultural symbols received from Paris, which it has gone on to diffuse to wider strata\n● 必须注意基本的社会学事实。 在法国其他地区，知识分子几乎总是生活和充当从巴黎接收的意识形态产品和文化符号的容器，并继续传播到更广泛的阶层\nPage 57 @ 28 April 2023 01:29 PM It has been an irony of fate that the writings of Parisian scholars devoted to intellectuals, their status, and their relationship to politics and government have in most cases ignored this geo-cultural aspect, or made only a very marginal reference to it.\n● 具有讽刺意味的是，巴黎学者致力于知识分子、他们的地位以及他们与政治和政府的关系的著作在大多数情况下都忽略了地缘文化方面，或者只是非常边缘地提及它。\nPage 57 @ 28 April 2023 01:33 PM When you live in a bubble, it is hard to see the world outside.\nPage 58 @ 28 April 2023 01:35 PM Concentration is a synonym of strength, density creates quality, while physical proximity to power (a section of politicians were also their former students) has engendered self-confidence and self-importance.\n● 集中是力量的代名词，密度创造品质，而与权力的身体接近（一部分政治家也是他们以前的学生）产生了自信和自尊。\nPage 58 @ 28 April 2023 01:34 PM When a bubble bursts, it deflates very quickly. All that is left for those in the bubble is to grumble about the difficulties of modernization, to investigate the problems of their wronged identity, or else the constant threat of communist or Islamic totalitarianism to their freedom of creation and the ‘French way of life’.\nPage 60 @ 28 April 2023 09:54 PM why ‘intellectuals’? Why not simply the better defined professional categories, such as writers, philosophers, poets, historians or artists? Why does the French language, and other languages in its wake, have the need for a common denominator for all the ‘accredited’ producers of knowledge and culture, despite their means of expression being so different?\nPage 60 @ 28 April 2023 09:55 PM There has always been a certain common foundation for the producers of symbolic goods, differentiating them both from producers of material goods and from the holders of political power.\nPage 61 @ 28 April 2023 09:57 PM Certain of those who first used it did so in the form of an insult, while others began on the contrary to give it a positive and sympathetic connotation.\nPage 64 @ 28 April 2023 10:01 PM On certain occasions, the term ‘intellectual’ serves to denote those scholars who, after gaining notoriety chiefly in the humanities but outside of their particular professional field, address the broad public or the government with a political and moral proclamation. Several historians have adopted this usage, which has likewise been popularized in the media, and it is why those scholars who view themselves as ‘pure’ scientists in no way recognize themselves in this definition.\nPage 66 @ 28 April 2023 10:04 PM I have always preferred to reserve ‘intelligentsia’ for the wider strata of diffusers and duplicators of culture, and keep ‘intellectuals’ for the producers of the ‘deep symbols’ that formalize public language.\nPage 67 @ 28 April 2023 10:06 PM The rapid democratization of higher education over the last few decades, however, has deeply modified the marks of cultural distinction, with the result of blurring the boundaries of membership of those groups viewed as embodying an elite.\nPage 68 @ 28 April 2023 10:07 PM how in our day the devaluing of the status of the traditional human and social ‘sciences’, in the intensified division of labour, can increase and intensify internal struggles.\n● 在我们这个时代，传统人文和社会“科学”的地位贬值，在劳动分工加剧的情况下，如何增加和加剧内部斗争。\nPage 68 @ 29 April 2023 01:18 AM It is said that, when he was asked why he was leaving the university to become secretary of state, Henry Kissinger replied that he had had enough of politics. The grain of truth in this joke relates to the academic milieu, rather than the personal ambitions of the honourable professor.\nPage 69 @ 29 April 2023 01:20 AM The American sociologist Lewis S. Feuer has suggested an excellent way of defining the difference between intellectuals and politicians. The former wield influence, the latter wield power.\nPage 70 @ 29 April 2023 01:20 AM it would appear that intellectuals act mainly in the world of symbols, and not directly in the system of social relations.\nPage 70 @ 29 April 2023 01:27 AM It follows that their power derives principally from the symbolic capital they have managed to accumulate.\nPage 71 @ 29 April 2023 01:28 AM We might say that to a certain degree the patterns of thought of the consumers of intellectual production are banks in which this important capital accumulates. Its symbolic power can be measured by academic qualifications, the awarding of prizes, the number of references and citations, the volume of publications, and many other practices current in the stock exchange of esteem and fame.\nPage 74 @ 29 April 2023 03:03 PM In the ‘popular democracies’, and other authoritarian democracies in the Third World, the learned provided their cultural goods while being happy to enjoy socio-economic privileges; the struggle for a wider autonomy of their specific cultural field scarcely led to significant results. The lack of stable traditions that could provide political conflict with legitimacy, and the absolute economic dependence of the learned on the apparatus of the nation-state, rather than that of the market, almost demolished any possibility of collective intellectual struggles to win an independent presence and acquire more influence\nPage 74 @ 29 April 2023 03:01 PM In the liberal democracies, on the other hand, relative autonomy became a marker of intellectual activity.\nPage 76 @ 29 April 2023 09:45 PM The majority of intellectuals are perceived in public opinion as figures prepared to challenge, independent of and outside a state that they do not hesitate to oppose.\nPage 86 @ 01 May 2023 01:23 AM Hundreds of philosophy professors whether Nietzschean or neo-Kantian, teachers of history and archaeology whether idealist or positivist, physicists and biologists, continued to publish and teach without a problem. Some of them even became enthusiastic Nazis.12 Martin Heidegger, the preeminent philosopher of the Weimar period, whom a growing consensus today tends to view as the most important philosopher of the twentieth century, was appointed rector of Freiburg University in 1933.\nPage 87 @ 01 May 2023 01:23 AM Just as the majority of British and French intellectuals were not anti-colonialist, so the majority of educated Germans were not anti-Nazi, and indeed a wide stratum of the ‘enlightened’ Western intelligentsia showed no opposition to totalitarianism.\nPage 88 @ 01 May 2023 01:25 AM George Bernard Shaw, as well as Beatrice and Sidney Webb, expressed their admiration for Stalin’s five-year plans. Berthold Brecht, Pablo Neruda and Louis Aragon saw Stalin as the ‘sun of the people’ and Soviet communism as the realization of human rationalism.\nPage 89 @ 01 May 2023 08:20 AM The situation was no different in the ‘people’s democracies’. Apart from recurrent confrontations between the state and a few isolated creative figures, the struggle to liberalize political culture and the autonomy of the intellectual field remained relatively marginal in relation to cultural production as a whole. Revolts and protests may well be imprinted in social memory, but the number of dissidents was actually quite negligible.\nPage 90 @ 01 May 2023 08:23 AM The great Cultural Revolution that shook China and caused large-scale massacres was a political project with little cultural about it, applied in the main by a new generation of young intelligentsia.\nPage 91 @ 01 May 2023 10:41 AM Those who would later call themselves the ‘new philosophers’, and many others who took up their ideas and popularized them, came from precisely this Maoism then in vogue.\nPage 92 @ 01 May 2023 10:43 AM ideological banner in the course of time. They were ‘revolutionaries’, warm admirers and champions of a totalitarian regime, when Maoism seemed in the process of imposing itself on a large part of the world. When its star declined, and with the advent of neo-conservatism, they abandoned this ‘revolution’ to become sycophants of the ‘anti-totalitarian’ bourgeois order, while maintaining the same intolerance and self-satisfaction\nPage 93 @ 01 May 2023 10:48 AM Why did these thinkers, and others with them, not prefer the less authoritarian and more rational currents of political revolt? Why did they bring themselves to sympathize with movements that organized a cult, and whose affinities with a distant dictatorship and its oppressive practices were visible to the naked eye\nPage 94 @ 01 May 2023 10:51 AM The world of symbols is the central object of the activity of intellectual elites, which frequently arouses tensions or frustrations towards the castes that hold power and are perceived as major decision-makers of the fate of the real world. The aspiration to free themselves from dependence on power and expand their autonomy has also played a notable part in the ambivalent relationship between the world of the intellect and that of political decisions.\nPage 95 @ 01 May 2023 12:56 PM Any attentive observer of the political and moral attitudes of intellectuals in the twentieth century will note that only a few of them have been able to preserve a clear and balanced judgement on the situations of distress that attend their age. This sad reality, however, should not lead to a misjudgement that would attribute to intellectuals a greater share of blame in the century’s tragedies than to other mortals.\n● 任何仔细观察 20 世纪知识分子的政治和道德态度的人都会注意到，他们中只有少数人能够对伴随他们这个时代的困境保持清晰而平衡的判断。 然而，这一可悲的现实不应导致误判，将本世纪悲剧的责任归咎于知识分子，而不是其他凡人。\nPage 97 @ 01 May 2023 01:42 PM Intellectuals, and the educated stratum as a whole, are no less moral than other humans, but neither should they be expected to be any better. Just as there has never been a causal link between cultural refinement and moral behaviour, so it is useless to seek a simple and direct relationship between the privileged status of the intellectual in society and their political ‘turpitudes’.\n● 知识分子和整个受教育阶层的道德水平不亚于其他人，但也不应期望他们比其他人更好。 正如文化修养与道德行为之间从来没有因果关系一样，寻求知识分子在社会中的特权地位与他们的政治“堕落”之间的简单而直接的关系是没有用的。\nPage 97 @ 01 May 2023 01:43 PM Many university and high school students took part in the Chinese Cultural Revolution of the 1960s, but it was also students who ten years later marched on Tiananmen Square and defied the tanks sent to repress their new demands for freedom and political pluralism.\nPage 98 @ 01 May 2023 01:46 PM the Western metropolises, the groups who protested against colonial conquests were not made up of trade unionists or socialist workers; they were most often minorities from intellectual milieus.18 In the United States, it was not truck drivers, waiters or shopkeepers who went to demonstrate against the war in Vietnam, but writers and the student youth\nPage 99 @ 01 May 2023 02:50 PM In fact, a global critique that presented intellectuals as either enemies of tradition or hostile to progress arose along with the very appearance of the term, and would last until the end of the twentieth century.\nPage 99 @ 01 May 2023 02:51 PM Biting condemnations of intellectuals were countless throughout the century, from Édouard Berth, a follower of Georges Sorel and author in 1914 of a virulent pamphlet Les Méfaits des intellectuels,20 through to Noam Chomsky, who characterized the educated classes in 1986 as ‘the most indoctrinated, most ignorant, most stupid part of the population’. ‘There are very good reasons for that,’ he added.21\nChapter 1: The Dreyfus Affairs: Human Rights or Author’s Rights? Page 118 @ 01 May 2023 03:14 PM Nothing is worse than these gangs of semi-intellectuals. A semi-culture destroys instinct without replacing it with a conscience. All these aristocrats of thought insist on maintaining that they do not think like the common herd.\nPage 122 @ 07 May 2023 07:26 PM Should the Dreyfus affair really be viewed as a single narrative?\nPage 123 @ 07 May 2023 07:26 PM The first affair was the trial of Dreyfus at the end of 1894: a judicial farce accompanied by a strong wave of Judeophobia. The second affair began three years later, in January 1898, with the publication of Émile Zola’s ‘J’accuse’ and the petitions of support that followed this.\nPage 128 @ 01 May 2023 04:46 PM New concepts generally appear when the need for them makes itself felt. When phenomena previously unknown appear in a particular historical context, the ideological vocabulary sports a new terminology, which is in turn a stimulus to developments.\nPage 130 @ 01 May 2023 04:48 PM the ‘intellectual’ was invented with the gradual formation of a public sphere in the capital of a liberal democracy.\nPage 130 @ 01 May 2023 04:49 PM What differentiated the supporters of a retrial of Dreyfus, who blamed the army general staff, from their famous forebears, from Voltaire to Victor Hugo, who had likewise intrepidly challenged the powers that be, yet without being referred to as ‘intellectuals\nPage 131 @ 01 May 2023 04:52 PM There was a certain homology between the notion of ‘scientist’ and the still vague term ‘intellectual’. Why not gratify those who supported Émile Zola with an aura of rationality and scientific truth?\nPage 133 @ 01 May 2023 04:54 PM The intervention of literati in the public arena had a historical precedent in the eighteenth century, when great thinkers came together to write the Encyclopédie. In Paris at that time, ‘men of letters’ formed the habit of gathering in a number of competing salons, each with a particular field of debate.\nPage 134 @ 01 May 2023 04:57 PM in proportion, the growth in the number of intellectuals was well above the rate of demographic growth.\nPage 135 @ 04 May 2023 01:15 AM still more important fact is that, thanks to the decline in illiteracy and with an ever-growing number of citizens speaking and reading the national language fluently, many writers could begin to live from the sale of their books and be far less dependent on the state apparatus\nPage 137 @ 04 May 2023 01:26 AM The idea that intellectuals are guided by a kind of human generosity, and ready to fight for universal values, follows from a particular conception of their social status. Perceived as independent figures, not in thrall to the interests of a particular social class or any government apparatus, intellectuals frequently appear as the ‘just’ of modern times, and the standard-bearers of morality. This explanation, however, has a number of weak points.\nPage 140 @ 04 May 2023 08:51 AM The second argument put forward to explain the mobilization of intellectuals in support of Dreyfus puts more weight on their professional ethic. By the very fact of their profession and the supposedly scientific and rational character of their activity, intellectuals would have a natural propensity to seek the ‘truth’ and to promote its triumph, outside their laboratories and universities as well as within.\nPage 142 @ 04 May 2023 11:44 AM The first revisionists, in late 1897 and early 1898, were actually such ‘irresponsible’ writers as Bernard Lazare and Stéphane Mallarmé, or ones only a little more ‘responsible’ such as Charles Péguy and Marcel Proust, rather than professors of logic or chemists working in a laboratory.\nPage 143 @ 05 May 2023 01:54 AM the birth of the Third Republic in the 1870s and the advent of mass democracy brought about a caesura between the ‘scientist’ and politics, as a result of the professionalization of both ‘scientists’ and politicians.\nPage 144 @ 05 May 2023 01:50 AM In fact, only a minority of them entered the public arena, attracted by the battles under way, even if they sometimes managed to draw with them rather wider circles\nPage 144 @ 05 May 2023 01:51 AM intellectual power in Europe was captured by a third generation of scientists whose characteristic was a growing specialization. The professionalization of new scholars led to their enclosing themselves in a narrow domain, thus leading to a new kind of cultural lack: ‘The specialist “knows” his own minimal corner of the universe quite well. But he is radically ignorant of all the rest.’\nPage 145 @ 05 May 2023 01:53 AM He is not learned, for he is formally ignorant of all that does not enter into his speciality; but neither is he ignorant, because he is ‘a scientist’, and ‘knows’ very well his own tiny portion of the universe. We shall have to say that he is a learned ignoramus, which is a very serious matter, as it implies that he is a person who is ignorant, not in the fashion of the ignorant man, but with all the petulance of one who is learned in his own special line.\nPage 146 @ 05 May 2023 11:53 PM At first sight, this argument seems completely logical. Yet it has the inconvenient fact that in other political cultures, faced with serious danger in the course of the advent of pluralist liberalism, no massive mobilization of democratic intellectuals is observable.\nPage 154 @ 06 May 2023 01:15 AM Charle uses Pierre Bourdieu’s conceptual apparatus to show that they were conditioned by their positioning in the literary or artistic field: an inferior rank in these fields led towards the Dreyfusard camp, while a well-established position in the dominant circle predisposed people to join the anti-Dreyfusards. In a more significant way, then, this was not fundamentally an ideological or moral battle, but rather a struggle for symbolic power\nPage 165 @ 06 May 2023 12:15 PM If we avoid lumping all kinds of anti-Semitism together, in the way that conventional political historiography has too often done, it is possible to distinguish how, at the time of the ‘affair’, anti-Jewish ideologies tipped the balance both with the supporters of a retrial and with its opponents.21\nPage 165 @ 06 May 2023 12:18 PM The same also holds for the concept of ‘republicanism’, the bearer of a spectrum of sensibilities that the ‘affair’ redistributed. Two examples are worth mentioning here: it was possible to be a republican and a democrat, and yet believe that raison d’état and the sacred role of the army were supreme values that could even justify the infringement of legal procedures – even trampling on the rights of the individual in an exceptional case. A state of emergency suspends human rights and political pluralism – who knew this better than the revolutionaries of 1793, the first democrats in history! There could also be another kind of republicans, who rejected the primacy of raison d’état and gave precedence to the rights of the individual, as laid down in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen. For this republicanism, as long as the social order is preserved, criticism may be legitimately directed at the apparatuses responsible for political order.\nPage 173 @ 07 May 2023 06:54 PM With the manipulative help of modern communications and, what was new for the time, a package of poisonous anti-Semitic incitements wrapped up in anti-German nationalism, journalists made a petty matter of espionage into a key media event.\n● 借助现代通信手段的巧妙帮助，以及当时的新事物，即包裹在反德民族主义中的一揽子有毒的反犹太主义煽动，记者们将一件小事间谍活动变成了一个重要的媒体事件。\nPage 174 @ 07 May 2023 07:01 PM To what extent did the engagement of other intellectuals – writers, artists, professors – who, in relation to journalists, saw themselves in the superior position of an elite, constitute a kind of confrontation or competition, not in the literary or academic field, but rather in a broader cultural field? The public sphere, established and\nPage 175 @ 07 May 2023 07:02 PM Although the confrontation of 1898 did not take place on this terrain, a significant fringe of the Parisian intellectual elite won a surprising victory over the cohort of journalists.\nPage 176 @ 07 May 2023 07:05 PM The result of this confrontation, in other words the victory of the Dreyfusards, of the republican centre left and of their own culture, reinforced in the following years the status of the ‘elite’ intellectuals in relation to the world of the press.\n● 这种对抗的结果，换句话说，是德雷福萨德派、共和中间派和他们自己的文化的胜利，在接下来的几年里加强了“精英”知识分子在新闻界的地位。\nPage 177 @ 07 May 2023 07:06 PM The tremendous development of the means of production, reproduction and distribution of modern culture has brought about a change in the balance of forces between the different categories of intellectuals\nPage 177 @ 07 May 2023 07:25 PM The organizers of media designed for the masses have achieved strongly dominant positions, not only in terms of the main modes of distribution of knowledge, but also in terms of the formation process of hegemonic ideologies, or rather ‘post-ideological’ sensibilities, as they are often called today. I shall return to this fundamental point in the fifth chapter.\nChapter 2: From Voltaire to Bourdieu: Who Are the ‘True Intellectuals’? Page 178 @ 07 May 2023 07:26 PM In France if you’re part of the intellectual elite and you cough, there’s a front-page story in Le Monde. That’s one of the reasons why French intellectual culture is so farcical – it’s like Hollywood.\nPage 180 @ 08 May 2023 11:27 AM Yet in my view, this brilliant thinker did not manage to formulate a completely coherent position across his long career. The tension in his work between ‘cold’ analysis and ‘hot’ commitment constantly gave rise to changing and unexpected forms of discourse, independently of Bourdieu’s general political positions, and the origin of these is not always easy to identify.\nPage 185 @ 08 May 2023 01:34 PM Who may be called a man of letters? Voltaire gives a clear and precise answer: This name is certainly not given to a man who, with little knowledge, only cultivates one genre. The man who, having only read novels, only writes novels; he who, without any literature, may happen to have composed a few plays for the theatre; who, lacking any science, has produced some sermons, are not to be counted among men of letters … The true men of letters are capable of entering different terrains, if they cannot cultivate them all.2\nPage 186 @ 08 May 2023 01:39 PM The mission of the ‘philosophe’ is clear and complex: it is incumbent on him to advocate a high morality and, along with this, to use all his intelligence to seek the truth, to refine the manners of the people, without forgetting at the same time to dispense instruction to kings and princes.\nPage 187 @ 08 May 2023 01:42 PM Capable as he is of thinking against the stream, the philosophe does not necessarily have to belong to honoured institutions. For Voltaire, the original thinker is a spiritual pioneer and freebooter, a frequent target for the prejudices of his contemporaries, who for the most part are mediocre or uneducated: ‘The philosophe is a lover of wisdom and truth: to be wise is to avoid the mad and the bad. The philosophe, therefore, can only live with philosophes.’\nPage 189 @ 08 May 2023 01:50 PM The praise he showers on Louis XIV for having transformed aristocratic patronage into royal patronage was clearly in accord with his liberal monarchist convictions, and perhaps also expressed the satisfaction of men of letters who had recently acquired greater autonomy in comparison with what had been their former level of personal dependence.\nPage 190 @ 08 May 2023 01:52 PM despite his complaints, truth obliges us to say that if Voltaire often had heavy debts to deal with, he never lived in an economically marginal situation, let alone one of poverty.\nPage 192 @ 08 May 2023 01:58 PM His representation of primitive man in this text is a kind of theoretical paradigm that Rousseau uses in order to criticize the social division of labour brought about by modernization, which he argues is expressed in a growing intellectualization.\nPage 193 @ 08 May 2023 02:04 PM It is philosophy that isolates him, and bids him say, at sight of the misfortunes of others: ‘Perish if you will, I am secure.’ Nothing but such general evils as threaten the whole community can disturb the tranquil sleep of the philosopher, or tear him from his bed. A murder may with impunity be committed under his window; he has only to put his hands to his ears and argue a little with himself, to prevent nature, which is shocked within him, from identifying itself with the unfortunate sufferer. Uncivilized man has not this admirable talent; and for want of reason and wisdom, is always foolishly ready to obey the first promptings of humanity.8\nPage 197 @ 08 May 2023 02:18 PM Auguste Comte and Alexis de Tocqueville were among the most original thinkers of the nineteenth century, and each is considered in his way a precursor of modern sociology. A quick look at their biographies could lead to the conclusion that the career of the former ended in resounding defeat, while the political trajectory of the latter was crowned with success.\nPage 198 @ 08 May 2023 02:22 PM institution, Comte displayed great self-confidence and always saw himself as the representative of a new science in the process of achieving a position of superiority in the field of cultural production (which was far from being the case\nPage 202 @ 10 May 2023 12:28 AM In the charter he wrote for this ‘spiritual society’, he gives its aim as completing and perfecting the last revolution by reformulating ideas and moral codes for it.\nPage 204 @ 08 May 2023 02:50 PM The prophet-like aspiration of intellectuals to reform the world always appeared to Tocqueville as a dangerous phenomenon in the history of contemporary France.\nPage 204 @ 08 May 2023 02:51 PM Tocqueville never felt sympathy for the writers of the Enlightenment, not hiding his opinion even when it was unfashionable. The reason he disliked them was precisely what subsequently brought these men of letters the label of ‘intellectuals’; in other words, their relationship to modern politics and their way of involving themselves in it.\nPage 206 @ 10 May 2023 03:55 PM The very condition of these writers predisposed them to favour general and abstract theories of government and to trust them blindly. In the almost total removal of their lives from the practical world, no direct experience came to modify the passions of their temperament. Nothing warned them about obstacles which existing conditions could bring to even the most desirable reforms.\nPage 207 @ 10 May 2023 03:56 PM The whole nation read these writers and ended up by adopting the instincts, the turn of mind, the inclinations and even the eccentricities characteristic of writers. The result was that, when it finally had to act, the nation brought all the habits of literature into politics … A frightening spectacle! For what is a good quality in a writer is a failing in a politician.\nPage 207 @ 10 May 2023 03:57 PM Literati create their work starting from a uniform and a priori project; but if politicians proceed in such a way, they transform history into a fearsome practice, precisely what happened at the time of the French Revolution.\nPage 208 @ 10 May 2023 04:06 PM What Tocqueville actually tells us is that these men of letters took power at the time of the Revolution, and he seems to have been the first to perceive that modern revolutions have been led and guided by cultural elites who metamorphosed into political elites.\nPage 209 @ 10 May 2023 04:08 PM Tocqueville thought the French man of letters should act as the modest and efficient servant of the public, bowing to the principles of an empirical and pragmatic policy.\nPage 210 @ 10 May 2023 04:08 PM This clearly implies getting away from the deceptive image of the indignant prophet coming to proclaim eternal truth to the world.\nPage 211 @ 10 May 2023 04:16 PM In sum, the intellectual is not someone whose activity consists in winning material advantages; he should rather be able to declare: ‘My kingdom is not of this world.’18\nPage 213 @ 10 May 2023 04:22 PM those of the previous generation, he insisted, had fought for ‘universal justice’, whereas those of his generation were serving a narrow and egoistic politics.\nPage 214 @ 10 May 2023 04:26 PM The author of Jean-Christophe had betrayed his mission as a true man of letters and deserved public rebuke. And yet those intellectuals who really did commit treason towards the highest universal values during the war, according to Benda, were the ones across the Rhine:\nPage 215 @ 10 May 2023 04:36 PM It must be admitted that the German ‘clerks’ led the way in this adhesion of the modern ‘clerk’ to patriotic fanaticism. The French ‘clerks’ were, and long remained, animated with the most perfect spirit of justice towards foreign cultures (think of the cosmopolitanism of the Romantics!) … The nationalist ‘clerk’ is essentially a German invention … most of the moral and political attitudes adopted by the ‘clerks’ of Europe in the past fifty years are of German origin.\nPage 215 @ 10 May 2023 04:36 PM In fact, he distinguishes two different ‘political passions’: one that grew up with the idea of the nation, and one that originated with the concept of class.\nPage 220 @ 11 May 2023 12:41 AM ‘It is especially noteworthy that, generally speaking, our professional thinkers are salaried employees of the State, that the weightiest opinions in this country are produced in exchange for public monies and are backed up by government sanctions.’\nPage 221 @ 11 May 2023 01:37 AM These learned clerks simply followed the crowd and obeyed the orders of the generals and politicians. These men, most of whom were not subject to mobilization, meekly went along with the forces of ignorance and exhorted those who had been mobilized to give up their lives. Every one of their students who died in battle was a martyr to their philosophy.\nPage 226 @ 15 May 2023 02:13 PM Given that the ends of science and its paths of development are universal par essence, every technician is therefore a potential intellectual.\nPage 229 @ 15 May 2023 02:18 PM Sartre was nevertheless confronted with a dilemma: neither himself nor his fellow committed intellectuals of the 1950s and ’60s had originally been technicians of practical knowledge, and at the end of the day the majority of ‘modern prophets’ were not scientists.\nPage 230 @ 15 May 2023 02:20 PM Writers and philosophers who appeared as prophets at the centre of the public stage were always a great irritant to Raymond Aron. The liberal sociologist maintained\nPage 231 @ 15 May 2023 02:22 PM The starting point of the ‘committed spectator’, as Raymond Aron liked to define himself, was not just anti-Sartrean, but more generally opposed to the currents of thought that Voltaire, Comte and Benda each embodied in their respective way. Aron’s judgement is unequivocal: they displayed ‘the same mixture of half-baked knowledge, of traditional prejudices, of preferences which are more aesthetic than rational, as in those of shopkeepers or industrialists’.35\nPage 232 @ 15 May 2023 02:23 PM Aron’s answer, unsurprisingly, is identical to that of Tocqueville a century earlier: the literati interested in politics express the bitterness and frustration of being kept at a distance from political action, and feel that their preaching is not taken into consideration.\nPage 232 @ 15 May 2023 02:24 PM The fact of being cut off from the sphere of political decision generates a messianic intellectualism and the insistent need to speak in the name of humanity as a whole. Parisian intellectuals, with their particular nostalgia for great ideas, consequently choose to intervene against every crime committed on earth, actually seeking to imitate the spiritual power that the Catholic church used to possess\nPage 234 @ 15 May 2023 02:51 PM In the 1950s, this atypical liberal thinker followed Tocqueville in referring to British literati as ‘moderate and reformist’, an example to follow.\nPage 235 @ 15 May 2023 02:54 PM But why do the intellectuals not admit to themselves that they are less interested in the standard of living of the working class than in the refinements of art and life? Why do they cling to democratic jargon when in fact they are trying to defend authentically aristocratic values against the invasion of mass-produced human beings and mass-produced commodities?39\nPage 237 @ 15 May 2023 03:06 PM Bourdieu gave a definition of intellectuals that was quite unambiguous and would hardly change in future years: ‘as holders of cultural capital, intellectuals are a (dominated) fraction of the dominant class and … a number of the stances they take up, in politics for example, derive from the ambiguity of their dominated-dominant position’.\nPage 240 @ 15 May 2023 03:11 PM [Intellectuals] are not representatives of universality, still less a ‘universal class’, but it does happen that, for historical reasons, they are often interested in universality … it is urgent today to create an international of artists and scientists able to propose or impose reflections and recommendations on the political and economic powers that be. I will just say – and I believe Michel Foucault would have agreed – that the only possible basis for a power that is specifically intellectual and intellectually legitimate, lies in the most complete autonomy in relation to all existing powers.\nPage 243 @ 15 May 2023 03:16 PM In the past, the ‘clerks’ who became fellow travellers or even organic intellectuals of political parties had always given priority to universal battles over the promotion of their own interests, forgetting in the process that ‘one defends the universal by defending the defenders of the universal’.\nPage 243 @ 15 May 2023 03:17 PM What must now be vigorously defended, Bourdieu explains, is the republic of scientists, writers and artists. But defended against whom? Against journalists, essayists and ‘bad sociologists’ who, if we are to believe the ‘good’ sociologist, are like foreign invading forces in the intellectual field\nGenerated at: 2023-05-15-15-31-44\n",

<p><em>And if the monarchist tradition has been replaced by a popular thirst for authoritarian and paternalist presidents, a deep nostalgia for knights and musketeers, seemingly foreign to bourgeois values, has also contributed to the prestige of this modern ‘nobility of mind’, who confront dangers and brandish their sharpened pens to defend truth and justice.</em></p>

<p><em>It is not only high politics that is decided in Paris, but also all the strategies, novelties and changes in the fields of cultural creation. By way of comparison, in Great Britain we find quite a high degree of centralization, but not equalling that of France. Oxford, Cambridge and even Edinburgh have maintained a power and effect in relation to London. In the United States, Germany or Italy, the morphology of the public sphere has a radically different shape: establishments of higher education, newspapers, reviews and periodicals, publishing houses and high cultural creation have always existed here in a far more dispersed and pluralist manner, whereas in France everything is essentially limited to Paris.</em></p>

A state of emergency suspends human rights and political pluralism – who knew this better than the revolutionaries of 1793, the first democrats in history! There could also be another kind of republicans, who rejected the primacy of raison d’état and gave precedence to the rights of the individual, as laid down in the Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen.

<p><em>Bourdieu gave a definition of intellectuals that was quite unambiguous and would hardly change in future years: ‘as holders of cultural capital, intellectuals are a (dominated) fraction of the dominant class and … a number of the stances they take up, in politics for example, derive from the ambiguity of their dominated-dominant position’.</em></p>

<p><em>[Intellectuals] are not representatives of universality, still less a ‘universal class’, but it does happen that, for historical reasons, they are often interested in universality … it is urgent today to create an international of artists and scientists able to propose or impose reflections and recommendations on the political and economic powers that be. I will just say – and I believe Michel Foucault would have agreed – that the only possible basis for a power that is specifically intellectual and intellectually legitimate, lies in the most complete autonomy in relation to all existing powers.</em></p>

<p><em>In the past, the ‘clerks’ who became fellow travellers or even organic intellectuals of political parties had always given priority to universal battles over the promotion of their own interests, forgetting in the process that ‘one defends the universal by defending the defenders of the universal’.</em></p>

<p><em>What must now be vigorously defended, Bourdieu explains, is the republic of scientists, writers and artists. But defended against whom? Against journalists, essayists and ‘bad sociologists’ who, if we are to believe the ‘good’ sociologist, are like foreign invading forces in the intellectual field</em></p>
