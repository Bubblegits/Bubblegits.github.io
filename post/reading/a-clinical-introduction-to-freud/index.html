  "articleBody": "Introduction Main point: Freud’s theory is about techniques used to access and impact the unconscious. Students nowadays often focus on the obstacle of reaching the repressed (resistance, defense and transference) rather than the repressed itself, however, Lacan suggests that these obstacles, especially transference, should be avoided rather than confronted.\nChapter1 Tracing a symptom back to its origin Main point: It’s important for Freud to study the first appearance of a symptom in detail, because this helps find its origin (“precipitating cause”). Symptoms form when a thought is obliged and the event giving rise to the thought is therefore forgotten (the whole process is called repression), so the analysand is required to go back to the scene and say what he/she feels.\nThe ubiquity of isolation strategies Chapter3 How to approach a dream After the analysand talks about his/her dream, analysts should break down the text into signifiers. They then return the isolated signifiers to analysands to find other signifiers associated to it. This can be hard because we often understand other people’s word as the signified but forget the second level——the signifier. Analysts should also pay attention to the hesitations and vacillations in dream text because they indicate a resistance.\nHow to get someone to associate to a dream An analysand tend to have his/her own logic when making associations. A figure in the dream is often composite, showing characteristics of several people in real life (condensation). The person in the dream can also be associated with some one who have a similar name (displacement).\nWhy are the wishes in dreams so often counterintuitive? Main Points: Dreams are compromise between unconscious wishes and semiwaking conscious. There is a censorship (the bar between conscious and unconscious) that help unconscious wishes go pass conscious, constituting a third party.\nAuthor | Censor | Public Unconscious | Preconscious | Conscious\nSubjectivity includes all three layers, namely:\nthe urges the part that knows nothing about the urges the part that censure the urges We often identify with others and take their urges as our own (Man’s desire is the other’s desire – Lacan), this can make us feel the desire to be foreign. This is especially important in self-destructing acts which actually makes someone around us happy. Some dreams can also be designed to thwart other’s wishes.\nAn unconscious wish is formulated in a complete sentence (or, the unconscious is structured like a language) Main point: A wish (conscious or unconscious) can often be stated (or formulated) into a sentence that takes the form of “I hope …” or “If only …”. This formulation requires synthetic effort. (What’s the role of the sentence**?**) In other words, the unconscious also thinks.\nHow not to approach a dream Main point: We should avoid “symbolic method” (make up stories that predict the future) and “decoding method” (give signifiers a fixed meaning) when interpreting dreams. A signifier in a dream means whatever the dreamer associates to it. From this point of view, some of Freud’s writings that supports a fixed sexual interpretation (such as phallus) are questionable.\nOverdetermination: A simple example Main points: dream often have multiple meanings.\nTools for interpretation Main points: There are generally four ways of interpretating a dream-element:\nTake it in a positive or negative sense Interpretate it historically Interpretate it symbolically Interpretate on its wording This part also mentioned some practical technique of interpretating a dream.\nDoes absolutely every dream fulfill a wish? Main points: Some of Freud’s early opinions, such as “every dream fulfill a wish”, seems to be unfalsifiable. He changed his opinion in late works that propose “trauma”, where dream end up generating anxiety. Trauma may be a distinct human aberration which has something to do with language.\nDaydreams, Fantasies, Slips, and bungled actions (parapraxes). Main points: Daydreams and fantasies are similar in structure to dreams.\nDreams and memories Main points: Freud’s initial work holds the opinion that all neurosis results from sexual trauma (obsession or hysteria) caused by “seduction”. Later, he thinks that the whole question of what really happened is less important than the effect of the (often fantasized) event on the analysand. Dreams don’t necessarily represent recovered memories.\nChapter 4 Obsession and the case of the Rat Man Main points: Many people find something helpful in the case of the Rat Man. He shows indecisiveness, uncertainty and doubt that indicates obsession. What’s more, he has a belief that he is superior to everyone as well as a fear that he is worthless.\nThe “precipitating cause” of his illness as an adult Main points: the rat man’s illness is caused by a repetition of the marital situation of his father: to choose from “a poor and deserving woman” and a young, beautiful woman.\nThe paralyzing effect of “destiny” Main points: We often find analysands to be in the similar situation with their parents.\nWhat was he doing instead of working? Main points: The rat man was masturbating as a form of rebellion. He also wished his parents suffer, but this wish is punished by the conscious through praying.\nThe structure of obsessive symptoms Main points: Obsession has a looping structure. In the rat man’s case, his sexual urge (force 1) is (indirectly) prohibited by his father(force 2), so he developed a wish to kill his father (back to force 1) and, further more, a fear of this wish being fulfilled (force 2 again) or wising to undo things that fulfilled the wish. The obsessive is only conscious of the fear, which ultimately repress the urge, other steps are ellipsed.\nIn order to maintain the balance between force one and force two, the obsessive tend to not making choices. By putting cathexis(energy) into the conflict, he/she may feel a sexual joy.\nJouissance in obsession Jouissance can be taken as satisfaction of an unbearably aggressive drive. In rat man’s case, punishment from his father gives him jouissance, so does imagining Gisa or his father being tortured.\nThe rat man’s childhood neurosis The rat man can’t remember his traumatic childhood experience at the beginning, in this case, some hypothesis should be proposed by the analyst.\nTransference and Transferences The rat man sometimes view Freud as the captain or his father, both of them had done something cruel to him. This behavior of transference help him act out things that he didn’t realize.\nPostmortem Main points: The rat man didn’t completely finish his analysis, maybe because Freud was pushing him too hard. Yet the analysis, especially the transference that tells him more about his rage, helped a lot.\nSome forms taken by obsession today: doing nothing and “nothing doing” Main points: Regarding the conflict in obsessives mentioned above, people who diligently doing nothing can be considered obsessive. Freud’s famous theory of oral, anal and genital stages also come with conflicts (between parents and children), the conflicts deprive us of jouissance and leads to our rebellion that gives us pleasure, rebellion by doing nothing (as our parents require).\nGoing through the motions: doing something as if one did not want to Some obsessives (especially perfectionists) “do and undo then redo a great many things.” They feel they are doing this for the significant other, so they leave some time “just for themselves”, often during midnight. There are also many other curious forms of obsessiveness.\nNothing else matters The protest in obsession seems to indicate that nothing compensates for their early loss. This is pretty much true for all of us, but obsessive have an especially strong feeling that it’s too late for them to do anything, demanding for a “replacement life”. CBT(cognitive-behavioral therapy) focus on the present and neglect such deprivation.\n按：强迫症和其他概念的关系还没有特别清楚，例如“匮乏”——可以在原初性欲的压抑中找到匮乏，强迫症可以被理解为是这一匮乏的再现吗？回想齐泽克所说“强迫症患者的问题在于，客体为他提供了太多的快感”，这种快感是通过推迟被建立起来的吗？你出于私心想问的是：匮乏处于什么位置？一个“否定性的事件“吗？”一小片实在界“？你如何面对匮乏？\nChapter 5 Hysteria and the case of Dora A lot of evidences show that Freud took control throughout Dora’s analysis and gave her little freedom. The main reason for this is that Freud wants to show his psychotherapeutic method to the world through this case.\nSynopsis of Ida’s situation Ida’s father had had syphilis prior to his marriage. He also had an affair with Frau K, an unhappy wife who was on the edge of divorce, after Ida’s whole family moved to a new town. Ida’s mother is a housewife and was unhappy about the marriage.\nIda’s “Entry” into analysis Though Ida herself didn’t want to change anything, her father insisted that she should go see Freud. Part of the reason that Freud “overly invested in the treatment” is that he want Ida to be impressed by his insights so that the analysis goes on.\nThe unfolding of Ida’s analysis The situation looks like a quartet: Ida was given to Herr K in trade of Frau K. Ida’s main concern is that she can do nothing to affect the relationship with her father and Frau K. However, some facts of Ida aided the relationship appeared during the analysis. Reproaches directed to others are often self-reproaches. The conscious notion “others are to blame” hides the unconscious notion “I am to blame”. This is the “dialectical reversal”.\nThe why and wherefore of Ida’s accusation The incident that shook up the quartet might be Herr K’s proposition. Herr’s remark on Frau being worthless shook Frau’s position (不知道這是不是一個可行的表達) in Ida’s structure of desire as an idol, and brought the romantic love to a sexual level. Ida may also identified with a governess to whom Herr K had propositioned in almost the same way. Yet all these explanations didn’t get conformation from Ida.\nFurther Mysteries Something curious is that Ida wasn’t angry at Frau K, the one who is involved in her father’s affair and revealed Ida’s secrets to Herr K. Freud initially believed that Ida was jealous of Frau K because she took her father away from her, but the mystery seems to indicate that Ida wanted Frau K’s love for herself. The jealousy (What jealousy**?** The one that Freud assumed Ida had of Frau K**?** Or the one of Ida’s father**?** What Fink wrote here is “her apparent jealousy of the relationship”) hides the desire for Frau K, that’s the “second dialectical reversal”. Yet Freud didn’t quite realize Ida’s love for Frau K’s, maybe because of the unanalyzed homosexual current in himself. If we analyze Ida’s love for Frau, we may find that Frau K was actually a mystery of Ida’s own femininity (according to Lacan). In other words, she wanted to be desired as Frau K was.\n",

  <div class="post-content"><h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#introduction">#</a></h2>
<p>Main point: Freud&rsquo;s theory is about techniques used to access and impact the unconscious. Students nowadays often focus on the obstacle of reaching the repressed (resistance, defense and transference) rather than the repressed itself, however, Lacan suggests that these obstacles, especially transference, should be avoided rather than confronted.</p>
<h2 id="chapter1-tracing-a-symptom-back-to-its-origin">Chapter1 Tracing a symptom back to its origin<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#chapter1-tracing-a-symptom-back-to-its-origin">#</a></h2>
<p>Main point:  It&rsquo;s important for Freud to study the first appearance of a symptom in detail, because this helps find its origin (&ldquo;precipitating cause&rdquo;). Symptoms form when a thought is obliged and the event giving rise to the thought is therefore forgotten (the whole process is called repression), so the analysand is required to go back to the scene and say what he/she feels.</p>
<h3 id="the-ubiquity-of-isolation-strategies">The ubiquity of isolation strategies<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-ubiquity-of-isolation-strategies">#</a></h3>

<h3 id="how-to-approach-a-dream">How to approach a dream<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-to-approach-a-dream">#</a></h3>
<p>After the analysand talks about his/her dream, analysts should break down the text into signifiers. They then return the isolated signifiers to analysands to find other signifiers associated to it. This can be hard because we often understand other people&rsquo;s word as the signified but forget the second level——the signifier. Analysts should also pay attention to the hesitations and vacillations in dream text because they indicate a resistance.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-get-someone-to-associate-to-a-dream">How to get someone to associate to a dream<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-to-get-someone-to-associate-to-a-dream">#</a></h3>
<p>An analysand tend to have his/her own logic when making associations. A figure in the dream is often composite, showing characteristics of several people in real life (condensation). The person in the dream can also be associated with some one who have a similar name (displacement).</p>
<h3 id="why-are-the-wishes-in-dreams-so-often-counterintuitive">Why are the wishes in dreams so often counterintuitive?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#why-are-the-wishes-in-dreams-so-often-counterintuitive">#</a></h3>
<p>Main Points: Dreams are compromise between unconscious wishes and semiwaking conscious. There is a censorship (the bar between conscious and unconscious) that help unconscious wishes go pass conscious, constituting a third party.</p>
<p>Author | Censor | Public     Unconscious | Preconscious | Conscious</p>
<p>Subjectivity includes all three layers, namely:</p>
<ol>
<li>the urges</li>
<li>the part that knows nothing about the urges</li>
<li>the part that censure the urges</li>
</ol>
<p>We often identify with others and take their urges as our own (Man&rsquo;s desire is the other&rsquo;s desire &ndash; Lacan), this can make us feel the desire to be foreign. This is especially important in self-destructing acts which actually makes someone around us happy. Some dreams can also be designed to thwart other&rsquo;s wishes.</p>
<h3 id="an-unconscious-wish-is-formulated-in-a-complete-sentence-or-the-unconscious-is-structured-like-a-language">An unconscious wish is formulated in a complete sentence (or, the unconscious is structured like a language)<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#an-unconscious-wish-is-formulated-in-a-complete-sentence-or-the-unconscious-is-structured-like-a-language">#</a></h3>
<p>Main point: A wish (conscious or unconscious) can often be stated (or formulated) into a sentence that takes the form of &ldquo;I hope &hellip;&rdquo; or &ldquo;If only &hellip;&rdquo;. This formulation requires synthetic effort. (What&rsquo;s the role of the sentence**?**) In other words, the unconscious also thinks.</p>
<h3 id="how-not-to-approach-a-dream">How not to approach a dream<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#how-not-to-approach-a-dream">#</a></h3>
<p>Main point: We should avoid &ldquo;symbolic method&rdquo; (make up stories that predict the future) and &ldquo;decoding method&rdquo; (give signifiers a fixed meaning) when interpreting dreams. A signifier in a dream means whatever the dreamer associates to it. From this point of view, some of Freud&rsquo;s writings that supports a fixed sexual interpretation (such as phallus) are questionable.</p>
<h3 id="overdetermination-a-simple-example">Overdetermination: A simple example<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#overdetermination-a-simple-example">#</a></h3>
<p>Main points: dream often have multiple meanings.</p>
<h3 id="tools-for-interpretation">Tools for interpretation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#tools-for-interpretation">#</a></h3>
<p>Main points: There are generally four ways of interpretating a dream-element:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take it in a positive or negative sense</li>
<li>Interpretate it historically</li>
<li>Interpretate it symbolically</li>
<li>Interpretate on its wording</li>
</ol>
<p>This part also mentioned some practical technique of interpretating a dream.</p>
<h3 id="does-absolutely-every-dream-fulfill-a-wish">Does absolutely every dream fulfill a wish?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#does-absolutely-every-dream-fulfill-a-wish">#</a></h3>
<p>Main points: Some of Freud&rsquo;s early opinions, such as &ldquo;every dream fulfill a wish&rdquo;, seems to be unfalsifiable. He changed his opinion in late works that propose &ldquo;trauma&rdquo;, where dream end up generating anxiety. Trauma may be a distinct human aberration which has something to do with language.</p>
<h3 id="daydreams-fantasies-slips-and-bungled-actions-parapraxes">Daydreams, Fantasies, Slips, and bungled actions (parapraxes).<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#daydreams-fantasies-slips-and-bungled-actions-parapraxes">#</a></h3>
<p>Main points: Daydreams and fantasies are similar in structure to dreams.</p>
<h3 id="dreams-and-memories">Dreams and memories<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#dreams-and-memories">#</a></h3>
<p>Main points: Freud&rsquo;s initial work holds the opinion that all neurosis results from sexual trauma (obsession or hysteria) caused by &ldquo;seduction&rdquo;. Later, he thinks that the whole question of what really happened is less important than the effect of the (often fantasized) event on the analysand. Dreams don&rsquo;t necessarily represent recovered memories.</p>
<h2 id="chapter-4-obsession-and-the-case-of-the-rat-man">Chapter 4 Obsession and the case of the Rat Man<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#chapter-4-obsession-and-the-case-of-the-rat-man">#</a></h2>
<p>Main points: Many people find something helpful in the case of the Rat Man. He shows indecisiveness, uncertainty and doubt that indicates obsession. What&rsquo;s more, he has a belief that he is superior to everyone as well as a fear that he is worthless.</p>
<h3 id="the-precipitating-cause-of-his-illness-as-an-adult">The &ldquo;precipitating cause&rdquo; of his illness as an adult<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-precipitating-cause-of-his-illness-as-an-adult">#</a></h3>
<p>Main points: the rat man&rsquo;s illness is caused by a repetition of the marital situation of his father: to choose from &ldquo;a poor and deserving woman&rdquo; and a young, beautiful woman.</p>
<h3 id="the-paralyzing-effect-of-destiny">The paralyzing effect of &ldquo;destiny&rdquo;<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-paralyzing-effect-of-destiny">#</a></h3>
<p>Main points: We often find analysands to be in the similar situation with their parents.</p>
<h3 id="what-was-he-doing-instead-of-working">What was he doing instead of working?<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#what-was-he-doing-instead-of-working">#</a></h3>
<p>Main points: The rat man was masturbating as a form of rebellion. He also wished his parents suffer, but this wish is punished by the conscious through praying.</p>
<h3 id="the-structure-of-obsessive-symptoms">The structure of obsessive symptoms<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-structure-of-obsessive-symptoms">#</a></h3>
<p>Main points: Obsession has a looping structure. In the rat man&rsquo;s case, his sexual urge (force 1) is (indirectly) prohibited by his father(force 2), so he developed a wish to kill his father (back to force 1) and, further more, a fear of this wish being fulfilled (force 2 again) or wising to undo things that fulfilled the wish. The obsessive is only conscious of the fear, which ultimately repress the urge, other steps are ellipsed.</p>
<p>In order to maintain the balance between force one and force two, the obsessive tend to not making choices. By putting cathexis(energy) into the conflict, he/she may feel a sexual joy.</p>
<h3 id="jouissance-in-obsession">Jouissance in obsession<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#jouissance-in-obsession">#</a></h3>
<p>Jouissance can be taken as satisfaction of an unbearably aggressive drive. In rat man&rsquo;s case, punishment from his father gives him jouissance, so does imagining Gisa or his father being tortured.</p>
<h3 id="the-rat-mans-childhood-neurosis">The rat man&rsquo;s childhood neurosis<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-rat-mans-childhood-neurosis">#</a></h3>
<p>The rat man can&rsquo;t remember his traumatic childhood experience at the beginning, in this case, some hypothesis should be proposed by the analyst.</p>
<h3 id="transference-and-transferences">Transference and Transferences<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#transference-and-transferences">#</a></h3>
<p>The rat man sometimes view Freud as the captain or his father, both of them had done something cruel to him. This behavior of transference help him act out things that he didn&rsquo;t realize.</p>
<h3 id="postmortem">Postmortem<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#postmortem">#</a></h3>
<p>Main points: The rat man didn&rsquo;t completely finish his analysis, maybe because Freud was pushing him too hard. Yet the analysis, especially the transference that tells him more about his rage, helped a lot.</p>
<h3 id="some-forms-taken-by-obsession-today-doing-nothing-and-nothing-doing">Some forms taken by obsession today: doing nothing and &ldquo;nothing doing&rdquo;<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#some-forms-taken-by-obsession-today-doing-nothing-and-nothing-doing">#</a></h3>
<p>Main points: Regarding the conflict in obsessives mentioned above, people who diligently doing nothing can be considered obsessive. Freud&rsquo;s famous theory of oral, anal and genital stages also come with conflicts (between parents and children), the conflicts deprive us of jouissance and leads to our rebellion that gives us pleasure, rebellion by doing nothing (as our parents require).</p>
<h3 id="going-through-the-motions-doing-something-as-if-one-did-not-want-to">Going through the motions: doing something as if one did not want to<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#going-through-the-motions-doing-something-as-if-one-did-not-want-to">#</a></h3>
<p>Some obsessives (especially perfectionists) &ldquo;do and undo then redo a great many things.&rdquo; They feel they are doing this for the significant other, so they leave some time &ldquo;just for themselves&rdquo;, often during midnight. There are also many other curious forms of obsessiveness.</p>
<h3 id="nothing-else-matters">Nothing else matters<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#nothing-else-matters">#</a></h3>
<p>The protest in obsession seems to indicate that nothing compensates for their early loss. This is pretty much true for all of us, but obsessive have an especially strong feeling that it&rsquo;s too late for them to do anything, demanding for a &ldquo;replacement life&rdquo;. CBT(cognitive-behavioral therapy) focus on the present and neglect such deprivation.</p>
<p>按：强迫症和其他概念的关系还没有特别清楚，例如“匮乏”——可以在原初性欲的压抑中找到匮乏，强迫症可以被理解为是这一匮乏的再现吗？回想齐泽克所说“强迫症患者的问题在于，客体为他提供了太多的快感”，这种快感是通过推迟被建立起来的吗？你出于私心想问的是：匮乏处于什么位置？一个“否定性的事件“吗？”一小片实在界“？你如何面对匮乏？</p>
<h3 id="chapter-5-hysteria-and-the-case-of-dora">Chapter 5 Hysteria and the case of Dora<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#chapter-5-hysteria-and-the-case-of-dora">#</a></h3>
<p>A lot of evidences show that Freud took control throughout Dora&rsquo;s analysis and gave her little freedom. The main reason for this is that Freud wants to show his psychotherapeutic method to the world through this case.</p>
<h3 id="synopsis-of-idas-situation">Synopsis of Ida&rsquo;s situation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#synopsis-of-idas-situation">#</a></h3>
<p>Ida&rsquo;s father had had syphilis prior to his marriage. He also had an affair with Frau K, an unhappy  wife who was on the edge of divorce, after Ida&rsquo;s whole family moved to a new town. Ida&rsquo;s mother is a housewife and was unhappy about the marriage.</p>
<h3 id="idas-entry-into-analysis">Ida&rsquo;s &ldquo;Entry&rdquo; into analysis<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#idas-entry-into-analysis">#</a></h3>
<p>Though Ida herself didn&rsquo;t want to change anything, her father insisted that she should go see Freud. Part of the reason that Freud &ldquo;overly invested in the treatment&rdquo; is that he want Ida to be impressed by his insights so that the analysis goes on.</p>
<h3 id="the-unfolding-of-idas-analysis">The unfolding of Ida&rsquo;s analysis<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-unfolding-of-idas-analysis">#</a></h3>
<p>The situation looks like a quartet: Ida was given to Herr K in trade of Frau K. Ida&rsquo;s main concern is that she can do nothing to affect the relationship with her father and Frau K. However, some facts of Ida aided the relationship appeared during the analysis. Reproaches directed to others are often self-reproaches. The conscious notion &ldquo;others are to blame&rdquo; hides the unconscious notion &ldquo;I am to blame&rdquo;. This is the &ldquo;dialectical reversal&rdquo;.</p>
<h4 id="the-why-and-wherefore-of-idas-accusation">The why and wherefore of Ida&rsquo;s accusation<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#the-why-and-wherefore-of-idas-accusation">#</a></h4>
<p>The incident that shook up the quartet might be Herr K&rsquo;s proposition. Herr&rsquo;s remark on Frau being worthless shook Frau&rsquo;s position (不知道這是不是一個可行的表達) in Ida&rsquo;s structure of desire as an idol, and brought the romantic love to a sexual level. Ida may also identified with a governess to whom Herr K had propositioned in almost the same way. Yet all these explanations didn&rsquo;t get conformation from Ida.</p>
<h3 id="further-mysteries">Further Mysteries<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#further-mysteries">#</a></h3>
<p>Something curious is that Ida wasn&rsquo;t angry at Frau K, the one who is involved in her father&rsquo;s affair and revealed Ida&rsquo;s secrets to Herr K. Freud initially believed that Ida was jealous of Frau K because she took her father away from her, but the mystery seems to indicate that Ida wanted Frau K&rsquo;s love for herself. The jealousy (What jealousy**?** The one that Freud assumed Ida had of Frau K**?** Or the one of Ida&rsquo;s father**?** What Fink wrote here is &ldquo;her apparent jealousy of the relationship&rdquo;) hides the desire for Frau K, that&rsquo;s the &ldquo;second dialectical reversal&rdquo;. Yet Freud didn&rsquo;t quite realize Ida&rsquo;s love for Frau K&rsquo;s, maybe because of the unanalyzed homosexual current in himself. If we analyze Ida&rsquo;s love for Frau, we may find that Frau K was actually a mystery of Ida&rsquo;s own femininity (according to Lacan). In other words, she wanted to be desired as Frau K was.</p>
