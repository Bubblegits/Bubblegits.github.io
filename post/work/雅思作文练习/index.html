  "articleBody": "IELTS11 Test1 writing Task1 The figure shows water consumption for industrial, agricultural and domestic proposes in six areas around the world: North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Central Asia and Southeast Asia.\nIn North America and Europe, water used in industry accounts for nearly half of total water consumption, and agriculture take up one-third of water. The percentage of domestic water consumption is around 15 percent, which ranks high among all the areas. The situation in remaining areas, however, is quite different. Most of the water is used for agricultural proposes, especially in Africa and Asia where over 80 percent of water is used in agriculture. These areas have little water left for industry and domestic proposes.\nTest1 Task2 Railways and roads play important roles in the traffic system of a country. Railways feature fast, long-way transportation while roads connect doors to doors. Governments often make different decisions on financial balance between railways and roads.\nI would suggest governments to invest more on railways than roads. Trains running on railways can be arranged by administrations, so railways under proper management have high efficiency. Nowadays, it’s common to see railways running faster than 300 km/h, which is a much higher speed compared with other vehicles. The emission of vehicles has always been a problem, trains, in comparison, is much more energy-conservative since it carries hundred or event thousands of people.\nChina governments have shown how railways can improve transport efficiency and boost economy in recent years. Through railway construction, high-speed trains connects almost every major city in china. Considering the large population and low vehicle possession in China, railways take up less territory and provide a convenient way of transport for general public.\nHigh-speed railways paint a picture for nation-wide transportation. As for transport in a city, light rails and subways can also help. They provide a economical option for citizens. Subways are especially suitable for metropolises because they don’t take space above ground.\nThe words written above doesn’t mean that we can neglect the importance of roads. They allow people to go wherever they want at anytime. If railways are the skeleton, then roads are the vessel. I would say that for countries with large territory and population, railways can be a focus of infrastructure construction.\nTest2 Task1 The figure shows the proportion of students who speak languages other than English at a British university in 2000 and 2010. Generally speaking, the proportion of students who speak foreign languages has growed from 80 percent to 90 percent. Among all kinds of languages, Spanish was always the most popular choice and its popularity is growing. German and French comes after, but a growth in the proportion of their speakers was not observed. In fact, French speakers accounts for less proportion in 2010. The percentage of people who speak a foreign languages other than the three above and people who speak secondary foreign language had increased.\nTest1 task2 As environmental problems getting increasing attention, waste recycle, an solution to the problem which needs the effort of every civilian, is also raising discussions. I think it is feasible for the government to make waste recycle a legal requirement.\nWaste comes from everywhere. Schools, offices, houses, everyone in these places produces wastes. This is why waste recycle can only been achieved through everyone’s effort. Some may argue that waste recycle can be done by workers in landfill, this seems to be a reasonable suggestion in the era of division of labor, but further consideration will tell us that this is not feasible. It will need huge amount of labor to deal with the rubbish hills in the landfill, besides, some recyclable wastes will become irrecyclable due to pollution.\nA main worry about legal regulations on waste recycle is that this is difficult to be conducted and may lead to violation of personal liberty. I think the regulation may face some difficulties in the first few weeks after promulgated, but the situation will get better when people acquire the habit of waste recycle. For example, in Shanghai, China, a waste recycle regulation was promulgated several years ago. They had volunteers watch over the waste spot in the residential area to make sure that all the waste are arranged properly. People gradually got used to the lifestyle of waste recycle, so the regulation didn’t cause much problem.\nWaste recycle is no hard work. For an ordinary family, it only need to prepare several garbage cans to collect different types of wastes. A regulation will make the notion of waste recycle spread wide.\nIn the past, people spent their entire lives doing one job. But nowadays, they change their jobs frequently. Please give reasons and your suggestions. Moving from one job to another is not a uncommon choice these days. People who work in a certain field may work in different companies or institutions from time to time, some will even choose to move from one field to another.\nThere are several causes for this phenomenon. Due to the rapid development of science and technology, innovation takes place in all kind of jobs. Architects in early times draw drafts with pencil and paper, nowadays computer programs do the calculation job for them. Those who can’t adapt to such changes have to find another job. We can also take it from a positive view of the phenomenon: Competitions between companies allow a job seeker to have multiple choices. Lousy bosses, intolerable working environment or simply an idea to try something new can all be the motivation for a worker to find a new job.\nIt is quite understandable to yearn for the old days when most people work in the same place for a whole life. They are familiar with their co-workers and the workplace is like home to them. Yet considering the fact that the whole economic system is getting more and more organized and the gap between junior and senior workers is narrowing, it is an unstoppable trend that choice on jobs becomes more flexible. Some suggestions may help workers to adapt to such circumstance. First, keep on learning after leaving school is very important, different jobs bring up different standards to meet, stay “up to date” will be of great advantage for your work.\nSome people think that children should learn to compete, but others think that children should be taught to cooperate so that they could become more useful adults. State some reason for both views and give your opinion. Let’s imagine what a child goes through in modern times. A child’s parents try their best to send him or her into a high-level primary school so that the child can “win at the start line”. After that, the child fights for better middle school, better college and better job. This whole process is full of competition, so it is natural that many people feel it an urge to teach their children to compete with others. Opponents, however, hold that cultivating the ability to co-operate should be the main focus of education.\nConsidering that education resource is limited, parents who want their children to get into prestigious schools thereby will hope that their children can be taught to compete with each other. It is true that many areas around the world adopt entrance exam for college enrollment or even middle school enrollment, and these exams are often translated into competition. Some students refuse to help their classmates so that they can have exclusive possession of knowledge, and this do bring them advantage. Some kids may behave more friendly with their classmates, but they are often taught to keep the notion in mind that they should work hard to overpass peers. The notion of competition actually acts as a motivation for them to study hard.\nwriting task1, with questions on The line graph demonstrates consumption of different types of fuel in USA from 1980 to 2030 with projections included. Categorically speaking, traditional energy sources such as coal, natural gas, petrol and oil accounts for a large proportion of total energy cost and are expected to maintain its leadership in the coming years. Newly-developed energy sources like nuclear, solar, wind and hydropower, however, will remain subordinate.\nIt can be explicitly observed that Petrol and oil are the main energy sources of the US. The consumption of them approximately equals to the sum of coal and natural gas. Among traditional resources, the expenditure of nature gas is predicted to stay relatively still, yet others will continue to increase.\nThe numerical difference between new sources of energy is much smaller. The expenditure of nuclear energy is slightly higher than others. Nuclear, solar and wind is predicted to get increasingly important in next 30 years, the future of hydropower, however, is uncertain and may have ups and downs.\nIELTS15 task1 The column chart shows information about coffee consumption in last four weeks in Australia. People live in five major cities: Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Hobart are divided into different groups according to their habit on coffee drinking. Generally speaking, people are apt to go to a cafe for coffee, arount 55% of residents in these cities have paid a visit to a cafe in last 4 weeks. Among those who buy coffee, a majority of them choose instant coffee rather than fresh coffee.\nResidents in some of the cities surveyed, like Sydney, Melbourne and Hobart, drinks coffee more frequently than residents in other cities, yet they share a similar pattern of coffee drinking as mentioned above. An notable exception occurs in Adelaide where the percentage of people who have bought instant coffee is slightly higher than those who went to a cafe. Relatively speaking, fresh coffee is most popular in Sydney. Almost 45% of people have bought fresh coffee in last 4 weeks\nIn some countries, owning a home rather than renting one is very important for people. Why might be the case? Do you think this is a positive or negative situation? Everyone needs a place to live, but people around the world have different opinions on t\nThe different opinions on dwellings family and will be passed down from generation to generation. One who sells the house is considered to be disrespectful to his or her ancestors. Chinese people have built-in senses of belonging to their homeland, and the dwelling is the tie between them and the land. This tradition develops and changes, but Chinese people nowadays still consider a house of ones own as a sign of maturity.\nPeople in others areas around the world, especially areas with sailing traditions, may be apt to dwell in wherever they goes. It is financially unfeasible to have a house everywhere, so renting one becomes a reasonable option. Unmarried people with an outgoing character may prefer renting a house since they don’t mind sharing their home with others or dealing with the landlord, some families that are strapped for money may also choose to rent a house because it provides them with enough space to live.\nThe style of living is highly subjective, so there is no absolute judgement to determine which one is better. I prefer owning a home because it makes me feel settled. Besides, if we add up all the money one spend on renting homes during a lifetime, the amout will be obviously larger than buying a domestic property.\nIELTS 15 TEST2 TASK1 The line chart depicts the trend of tourists visiting a caribbean island in different ways (staying on cruise ships or staying on island) from 2010 to 2017. Generally speaking, the number of tourists have been continuously growing, mainly contributed by visitors staying on the cruise ships.\nThe number of visitors staying on island doubled from 2011 to 2013, reaching a level of 1.5 millions, but then plateaued in the next few years. 2016 saw a small drop in the number, and it quickly recovered to the previous level. Visitors on the cruise boat, on the other hand, fluctuated a little bit in the first three years, then began to soar.\n",

<p>The figure shows water consumption for industrial, agricultural and domestic proposes in six areas around the world: North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Central Asia and Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>In North America and Europe, water used in industry accounts for nearly half of total water consumption, and agriculture take up one-third of water. The percentage of domestic water consumption is around 15 percent, which ranks high among all the areas. The situation in remaining areas, however, is quite different. Most of the water is used for agricultural proposes, especially in Africa and Asia where over 80 percent of water is used in agriculture. These areas have little water left for industry and domestic proposes.</p>

<p>Railways and roads play important roles in the traffic system of a country. Railways feature fast, long-way transportation while roads connect doors to doors. Governments often make different decisions on financial balance between railways and roads.</p>
<p>I would suggest governments to invest more on railways than roads. Trains running on railways can be arranged by administrations, so railways under proper management have high efficiency. Nowadays, it&rsquo;s common to see railways running faster than 300 km/h, which is a much higher speed compared with other vehicles. The emission of vehicles has always been a problem, trains, in comparison, is much more energy-conservative since it carries hundred or event thousands of people.</p>
<p>China governments have shown how railways can improve transport efficiency and boost economy in recent years. Through railway construction, high-speed trains connects almost every major city in china. Considering the large population and low vehicle possession in China, railways take up less territory and provide a convenient way of transport for general public.</p>
<p>High-speed railways paint a picture for nation-wide transportation. As for transport in a city, light rails and subways can also help. They provide a economical option for citizens. Subways are especially suitable for metropolises because they don&rsquo;t take space above ground.</p>
<p>The words written above doesn&rsquo;t mean that we can neglect the importance of roads. They allow people to go wherever they want at anytime. If railways are the skeleton, then roads are the vessel. I would say that for countries with large territory and population, railways can be a focus of infrastructure construction.</p>

<p>The figure shows the proportion of students who speak languages other than English at a British university in 2000 and 2010. Generally speaking, the proportion of students who speak foreign languages has growed from 80 percent to 90 percent. Among all kinds of languages, Spanish was always the most popular choice and its popularity is growing. German and French comes after, but a growth in the proportion of their speakers was not observed. In fact, French speakers accounts for less proportion in 2010. The percentage of people who speak a foreign languages other than the three above and people who speak secondary foreign language had increased.</p>

<p>As environmental problems getting increasing attention, waste recycle, an solution to the problem which needs the effort of every civilian, is also raising discussions. I think it is feasible for the government to make waste recycle a legal requirement.</p>
<p>Waste comes from everywhere. Schools, offices, houses, everyone in these places produces wastes. This is why waste recycle can only been achieved through everyone&rsquo;s effort. Some may argue that waste recycle can be done by workers in landfill, this seems to be a reasonable suggestion in the era of division of labor, but further consideration will tell us that this is not feasible. It will need huge amount of labor to deal with the rubbish hills in the landfill, besides, some recyclable wastes will become irrecyclable due to pollution.</p>
<p>A main worry about legal regulations on waste recycle is that this is difficult to be conducted and may lead to violation of personal liberty. I think the regulation may face some difficulties in the first few weeks after promulgated, but the situation will get better when people acquire the habit of waste recycle. For example, in Shanghai, China, a waste recycle regulation was promulgated several years ago. They had volunteers watch over the waste spot in the residential area to make sure that all the waste are arranged properly. People gradually got used to the lifestyle of waste recycle, so the regulation didn&rsquo;t cause much problem.</p>
<p>Waste recycle is no hard work. For an ordinary family, it only need to prepare several garbage cans to collect different types of wastes. A regulation will make the notion of waste recycle spread wide.</p>

<p>Moving from one job to another is not a uncommon choice these days. People who work in a certain field may work in different companies or institutions from time to time, some will even choose to move from one field to another.</p>
<p>There are several causes for this phenomenon. Due to the rapid development of science and technology, innovation takes place in all kind of jobs. Architects in early times draw drafts with pencil and paper, nowadays computer programs do the calculation job for them. Those who can&rsquo;t adapt to such changes have to find another job. We can also take it from a positive view of the phenomenon: Competitions between companies allow a job seeker to have multiple choices. Lousy bosses, intolerable working environment or simply an idea to try something new can all be the motivation for a worker to find a new job.</p>
<p>It is quite understandable to yearn for the old days when most people work in the same place for a whole life. They are familiar with their co-workers and the workplace is like home to them. Yet considering the fact that the whole economic system is getting more and more organized and the gap between junior and senior workers is narrowing, it is an unstoppable trend that choice on jobs becomes more flexible. Some suggestions may help workers to adapt to such circumstance. First, keep on learning after leaving school is very important, different jobs bring up different standards to meet, stay &ldquo;up to date&rdquo; will be of great advantage for your work.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine what a child goes through in modern times. A child&rsquo;s parents try their best to send him or her into a high-level primary school so that the child can &ldquo;win at the start line&rdquo;. After that, the child fights for better middle school, better college and better job. This whole process is full of competition, so it is natural that many people feel it an urge to teach their children to compete with others. Opponents, however, hold that cultivating the ability to co-operate should be the main focus of education.</p>
<p>Considering that education resource is limited, parents who want their children to get into prestigious schools thereby will hope that their children can be taught to compete with each other. It is true that many areas around the world adopt entrance exam for college enrollment or even middle school enrollment, and these exams are often translated into competition. Some students refuse to help their classmates so that they can have exclusive possession of knowledge, and this do bring them advantage. Some kids may behave more friendly with their classmates, but they are often taught to keep the notion in mind that they should work hard to overpass peers. The notion of competition actually acts as a motivation for them to study hard.</p>

</p>
<p>The line graph demonstrates consumption of different types of fuel in USA from 1980 to 2030 with projections included. Categorically speaking, traditional energy sources such as coal, natural gas, petrol and oil accounts for a large proportion of total energy cost and are expected to maintain its leadership in the coming years. Newly-developed energy sources like nuclear, solar, wind and hydropower, however, will remain subordinate.</p>
<p>It can be explicitly observed that Petrol and oil are the main energy sources of the US. The consumption of them approximately equals to the sum of coal and natural gas. Among traditional resources, the expenditure of nature gas is predicted to stay relatively still, yet others will continue to increase.</p>
<p>The numerical difference between new sources of energy is much smaller. The expenditure of nuclear energy is slightly higher than others. Nuclear, solar and wind is predicted to get increasingly important in next 30 years, the future of hydropower, however, is uncertain and may have ups and downs.</p>

<p>The column chart shows information about coffee consumption in last four weeks in Australia. People live in five major cities: Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Hobart are divided into different groups according to their habit on coffee drinking. Generally speaking, people are apt to go to a cafe for coffee, arount 55% of residents in these cities have paid a visit to a cafe in last 4 weeks. Among those who buy coffee, a majority of them choose instant coffee rather than fresh coffee.</p>
<p>Residents in some of the cities surveyed, like Sydney, Melbourne and Hobart, drinks coffee more frequently than residents in other cities, yet they share a similar pattern of coffee drinking as mentioned above. An notable exception occurs in Adelaide where the percentage of people who have bought instant coffee is slightly higher than those who went to a cafe. Relatively speaking, fresh coffee is most popular in Sydney. Almost 45% of people have bought fresh coffee in last 4 weeks</p>

<p>Everyone needs a place to live, but people around the world have different opinions on t</p>
<p>The different opinions on dwellings family and will be passed down from generation to generation. One who sells the house is considered to be disrespectful to his or her ancestors. Chinese people have built-in senses of belonging to their homeland, and the dwelling is the tie between them and the land. This tradition develops and changes, but Chinese people nowadays still consider a house of ones own as a sign of maturity.</p>
<p>People in others areas around the world, especially areas with sailing traditions, may be apt to dwell in wherever they goes. It is financially unfeasible to have a house everywhere, so renting one becomes a reasonable option. Unmarried people with an outgoing character may prefer renting a house since they don&rsquo;t mind sharing their home with others or dealing with the landlord, some families that are strapped for money may also choose to rent a house because it provides them with enough space to live.</p>
<p>The style of living is highly subjective, so there is no absolute judgement to determine which one is better. I prefer owning a home because it makes me feel settled. Besides, if we add up all the money one spend on renting homes during a lifetime, the amout will be obviously larger than buying a domestic property.</p>

<p>The line chart depicts the  trend of tourists visiting a caribbean island in different ways (staying on cruise ships or staying on island) from 2010 to 2017. Generally speaking, the number of tourists have been continuously growing, mainly contributed by visitors staying on the cruise ships.</p>
<p>The number of visitors staying on island doubled from 2011 to 2013, reaching a level of 1.5 millions, but then plateaued in the next few years. 2016 saw a small drop in the number, and it quickly recovered to the previous level. Visitors on the cruise boat, on the other hand, fluctuated a little bit in the first three years, then began to soar.</p>
